# Basic Python

A collection of various basic Python projects I have completed

## Excercise 1

A. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?

B. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)πr. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 4? With radius 6? (Hint: pi=3.14159265 but import and use the exact number from the necessary module)

C. Show in Python for -40° is the same temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius (Run the conversion for -40°).

D. Suppose that you have a rectangular prism R with sides a, 2a, 3a and a cube C with side a. How many of C can fit in R?

## Excercise 2

A. Write a function to convert minutes to miliseconds.

B. Define a function to find the average of two exam scores.

C. Use math module import to use square root and compute the roots of a quatratic equation.

D. Define a function to convert Kelvin to Réaumur, then Réaumur to Celsius. Use different functions, and call one inside the other, if necessary.

E. Say you have a cube with side of n. And you have some amount of marbles (round, sphere) with radius n/4 How many marbles can you fit in the cube? Obtain the solution with the use of functions.

F. Write a function to give the following output: (PS: \n, \t, and loops are not allowed)
